Neatline Blank Slate Exhibit Theme
==================================

The idea of this Neatline exhibit theme is simple, provide a blank canvas that
can be used to make themes for individual Neatline exhibits easily. This theme
on its own does nothing, and that's by design. The files included, where they
contain functional code, simply duplicate the default files from Neatline. I've
included some brief introductions in each file, adapted from a post on
neatline.org titled [Creating themes for individual Neatline exhibits](http://neatline.org/2014/04/01/creating-themes-for-individual-neatline-exhibits/).
What the files in this repository do is give you the basic skeleton of a
Neatline exhibit theme that you can use as the basis for your own exhibit theme.

If you want to use this theme as the basis for your own Neatline exhibit theme,
you can fork and clone this repo, or if that's gibberish to you, you can
download a .zip of this repo from the green "Clone or download" button. Either
way, you want the folder containing these files to be in your theme directory,
under `neatline/exhibits/themes/your-exhibit-slug`, replacing
`your-exhibit-slug` with the slug from your exhibit.
